# Overview
A sample landing page using tailwindcss. This is based off [Brad Travery's example](https://github.com/bradtraversy/tailwind-landing-page). Most layout and css combinations used are original and wasn't copied from Brad's repo so I could learn and experience tailwindcss.

# How to run
- Install dependencies - `npm run install` or `yarn install` if you're using yarn.
- Running the sample - `npm run watch` for development; `npm run build` for building once and run. 
  
  If you're using VSCode, you can use [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to browse the page.
